### List webhooks within the web app

The _Webhooks_ overview screen shows a list of the most recent webhook calls made, their status, possible errors, and the target URL (a Slack url in the below example).

### List webhooks via API

To list all webhooks endpoint in a space, use the following sample code:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.contentful.com/spaces/<SPACE_ID>/webhook_definitions"
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.contentful.management.v1+json"
```

[Find more details on listing the webhooks in a space with the API in our reference docs](/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/webhooks/webhooks-collection/get-all-webhooks-of-a-space).
