# Overview
Webhooks in Contentful can be tailored so you only receive calls for the events you care about. You can do this in two ways:

- selection of a triggering event(s)
- filtering based on properties of a webhook payload

An event is a combination of the entity type and an action performed on it. For example the `Entry.save` event happens when an
entry is updated with the CMA. `ContentManagement.Entry.save` is the topic for this event.

To select which events should trigger a webhook call, set the `topics` property of a webhook to one or more event names. You can use
a wildcard character `*` to indicate that all entity types or actions should cause a webhook call. Please note that if you use the
wildcard character and we add new entity types or actions, your webhook receiver will be called with new events.

Possible values for `topics` are:

- `["*.*"]` will trigger a webhook call for all the supported events in Contentful
- `["Entry.*"]` will trigger a webhook call for all actions performed on entries
- `["*.save"]` will trigger a webhook call when any of supported entities is saved
- `["Entry.save", "Entry.delete"]` will trigger a webhook call only for the events listed

Once triggering events are selected, webhook calls can be narrowed down further using webhook payload filtering.

You can filter on the following webhook payload properties:
- `sys.id` - entity ID
- `sys.environment.sys.id` - environment ID
- `sys.contentType.sys.id` - content type ID (applicable only to Entry events)
- `sys.createdBy.sys.id` - User ID, created by (not applicable to Unpublish and Delete events)
- `sys.updated.sys.id` - User ID, updated by (not applicable to Unpublish and Delete events)
- `sys.deletedBy.sys.id` - User ID, deleted by (only applicable to Unpublish and Delete events)

These properties can be used as `doc` in the filters. 

## Available Filters
Operator | Example | Behavior
---------|---------|---------
equality | `{"equals": [{"doc": "sys.id"}, "main_nav"]}` | will trigger only for entity with ID `main_nav`
negation of equality | `{"not": {"equals": [{"doc": "sys.id"}, "main_nav"]}}` | will trigger for all entities but entity with ID `main_nav`
inclusion | `{"in": [{"doc": "sys.environment.sys.id"}, ["qa", "staging"]]}` | will trigger if environment of an entity is either `qa` or `staging`
negation of inclusion | `{"not": {"in": [{"doc": "sys.environment.sys.id"}, ["qa", "staging"]]}}` | will trigger if environment of an entity is neither `qa` nor `staging`
regular expression | `{"regexp": [{"doc": "sys.environment.sys.id"}, {"pattern": "^ci-.+$"}]}` | will trigger for all environments prefixed with `ci-`
negation of regular expression | `{"not": {"regexp": [{"doc": "sys.environment.sys.id"}, {"pattern": "^ci-.+$"}]}}` | will trigger for all environments that are not prefixed with `ci-`

The `filters` property of a webhook holds zero or more filters in an array. While deciding if a webhook should be called, all
filters are joined with logical `AND`.

If there is no value for the `filters` property (or it is `null`) then by default a webhook will be triggered only in the `master`
environment.

Combining all the mechanisms together we can achieve fine-grained webhook calls. The following webhook will be triggered only for
(un)publish actions performed on entries with IDs `main_nav` or `footer_nav` in all environments prefixed with `test-`:

```json
{
  "name": "My webhook",
  "url": "https://my-webhook-receiver.com/ping",
  "topics": [
    "Entry.publish",
    "Entry.unpublish"
  ],
  "filters": [
    {"in": [{"doc": "sys.id"}, ["main_nav", "footer_nav"]]},
    {"regexp": [{"doc": "sys.environment.sys.id"}, {"pattern": "^test-.+$"}]}
  ]
}
```
