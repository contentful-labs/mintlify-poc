# Content Management API

Contentful's Content Management API (CMA) helps you manage content in your spaces. To learn more about how to model your content, [read our modeling guide](/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/).

**NOTE**: You can use the CMA to deliver and manage content, but you shouldn't use it to deliver large amounts of content and instead use the [Content Delivery API](/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/). The structure of responses from the CMA differs from the CDA as `GET` responses retrieve the entirety of items (i.e. all localized and unpublished content).

## Authentication

You access the API securely via HTTPS, and it will be available to clients authenticating with an access token.

Learn about authenticating to the CMA and get your access token from the [developer center](/developers/docs/references/authentication/#the-content-management-api).

## Resource IDs

When creating resources, you can specify an ID or let the API generate a random ID for you. If you choose an ID yourself it must adhere to the following rules:

- It has a length between 1 and 64 characters.
- It only includes alphanumeric characters, dots `.`, hyphens `-` or underscores `_`.

Represented as a regular expression, this is `/^[a-zA-Z0-9-_.]{1,64}$/`.
