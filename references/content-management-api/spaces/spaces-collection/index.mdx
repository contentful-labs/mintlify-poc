Spaces are containers for content types and content, and API clients can fetch data from one or more spaces. You can be a member of multiple organizations, and owner and admin roles in the organization can create spaces in organizations.

When you sign up to Contentul for the first time, you create a new organization. When you're invited to an existing organization, you become a member of that organization.

<Note>If you have a single organization, any space you create will be automatically associated with that organization. If you're an admin or an owner in multiple organizations you need to pass the ID of the organization with the `X-Contentful-Organization` header that you want to create the space in.</Note>

<Note>If you are on our [latest pricing model](/pricing/) and have plans attached to your spaces, creating a new space via the API will assign the smallest available plan to it. If you've reached your limit of free spaces and have no payment details on file, you won't be able to create more spaces until you add payment details.</Note>
